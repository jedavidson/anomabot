# Anomabot

This project serves no real purpose other than for my own experimentation with Discord and the [`discord.py`](https://discordpy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) API it is made in.

However, the bot can currently do such fun things as
- encode/decode a message in the NATO phonetic alphabet using `^nato`;
- encode (partially) a message using a Vigenere cipher using `^vigenere`;
- grab a random [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/) problem using `^leetcode`;
- emojify a piece of text using `^emojify`.

Given that `discord.py`'s original maintainer has stepped down following some major changes to the way Discord bots will have to work in the future, I'm not sure how much I'll keep experimenting with this particular API, and so this bot may end up being a humble one forever...
